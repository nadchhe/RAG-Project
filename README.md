# RAG-Project
This project involves developing an advanced AI-powered QA assistant that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, contextually relevant answers to customer questions. The assistant integrates information retrieval from a SANAD dataset with generative AI capabilities to deliver precise and detailed responses in real-time.
